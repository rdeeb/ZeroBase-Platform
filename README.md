ZeroBase Platform
=================

This is the base of the ZeroBase Wordpress Framework. This gives the ZeroBase powered plugins and themes a common base to work on. This consists in a combination of mini frameworks wich aids in the extention of wordpress functionalities.

ZeroBase provides themes and plugins developers, with an standard way to extend Wordpress by allowing them to use a base set of tools that will allow them to implement different type of extentions using the same type of workflow for every each one of them. This will reduce the major labor work and give the developer the ability to deliver the same level of user experience that a Wordpress user is used to, while taking away all the hazle of having to work with different programming aproaches ussually forced by the Wordpress core functionalities.
